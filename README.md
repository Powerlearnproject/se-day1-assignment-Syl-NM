Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is a displine that deals with design,development,testing and maintenance of software applications.in other wordsit is the systematic application of engineering principles,methodsand toolsto development and maintance of high-quality software systems.
As branch of computer science it plays important roles in the technology industry which includes;
   creation of software applications and systemsthat power various aspects of mordern life including, communication, health care among others.
   it also does drive innovation in the tech indusrty by providing tools and techniquesneccesary to create soft ware solutions.
   

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Early programming days - this is the period where first programmable computrs were made  and the development of first high-level languages like fortran.
Estblishment of software engineering in the 1960s-This is the  period where software was established as a displine. it was coined at NATO software engineering confrence.
Structured programming and design-in the 1970s-this is the period where techiques like modular proramming and top-down emerged to improve code redability.
Object oriented programing in the 1980s with languages like c++
The rise of agile methodloligies in 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirments:Gathering and documenting user needs and and system reqirements
Design:involves creating the design of the software architecture and user interfsce
Implementation:Writing code and building the software according to design and specification.
testing:conduction tesr to ensure the system meets the standards
Deployment:releasing software to intentended users
Maintanance:this is by providing support after deployment


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
For Waterfall the procces flow is linear and sequential and has a rigid structure while Agile structure is iterative and incremental and it has a flexible strucure.
Waterfall has fixed requirements  while Agile has evolving requrements
in customer involvement waterfall methodolgy is with limeted customer interction while Agile high customer involvement.
Despite the diffrences the methodolies share simmilarities in that:
Both aim to deliver high-qyality priducts that meets customers needs.
Also both of them have clearly defined phases.
And also empahises on testing
Agile methodolgy would be appropriate for developing a mobile app for startup this is because it is suitable for projects in dynamic enviroment whose requirements may change frequently and user feedback is essential.
 For Waterfall developing a Medical device would be appropriate this is because waterfall is best suited for projects with stable,well-defines reqirements where changesare minimal.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer: he or she is responsiblefor writing code and implementing software solutions
Quality assurance engineer: he plays a role of ensuring software quality by designing and executing test plans.
The project manager overseas the planning,excution and delivery of software projects


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Theyenhance productivity,collaborationand code quality by providing devolpers features such as code editors,version controls,debugging tools among others. 
examples of IDEs include,visual studio,Eclipse,Intelij IDEA and for VCS include,Git and Subversion


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
changing requirements:requirements may chage in the development cycle leading to project delays.Efeective communication can help ovoid this challage.
tight deadlines:pressure to deliver software products an d schedule can lead to compromise quality of the system. This can be prevented by regular reassement of project gols and timelines.
technical debut:accrued from shortcuts, this can impend futre development efforts nd also lead to an increased maintance cost. One can curb this  by using agile metthodologies


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing, this is the testing of individusl components or modules of software
Intergration testing, this is testing interactions between diffrent components or subsystems.
sytem testing, it is testing the entire system as a whole.
and accepatance testing it is testing the software aganist user requirement to ensure it meets the users needs.
The tesing help to indentify anf fix defects early in the development process ensuring production of high-qualitu software products


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 it is the process of desiging and refining inputs prompts to guide a language model.it about craffing questions to get best possible responses from AI models.

Prompt engineering helps in making questions clear and specific,so that AI understands what you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: Tell me about weather
the improved prompt would be provide the current weather conditions in Nairobi and 3 day forecast including temperature and precipitation.
the improveec one is more effective because it is clear,specific, and concise. it removes ambigity by specifying location(Nairobi),the time frame( 3days) and the details needed(temperature and precipitation)
